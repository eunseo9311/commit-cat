# CommitCat 🐈‍⬛

**CommitCat** is a developer desktop companion that grows with your coding activity.

It lives on your desktop, watches your development environment (locally), and reacts to your work — commits, coding time, focus sessions, and more.

> 🐱 A tiny coding partner that never judges you (even at 3 AM).

## ⭐ Why CommitCat?

Most productivity tools track you.

CommitCat **lives with you.**

It celebrates your commits, keeps you company during late-night debugging, and quietly disappears when you need focus.
